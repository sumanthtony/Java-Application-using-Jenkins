# Java-Application-using-Jenkins
Setting up Jenkins to build a simple Java application using Maven â€” your first step into CI/CD.

Following steps taken to complete the task:

NOTE: 
1. SINCE I ALREADY HAVE ONE REPOSITORY **(https://github.com/sumanthtony/one_repo)** USED AS A PART OF MY COURSE LEARNINGS USED SAME CODE TO DEPLOY **JAVA** APPLICATION USING **JENKINS.**
2. DID ADDITIONAL TASK AS WELL NOT ONLY JUST BUILD THE CODE USING **MAVEN BUILD TOOL**, DEPLOYED THE **WAR FILE** IN **TOMCAT** AND DEPLOYED THE **MOBILE APPLICATION** TO COMPLETE OVERALL DEVOPS LIFE CYCLE ----**CODE----BUILD---TEST----DEPLOY**.

 **--->** Launched **2 EC2 servers** and installed packages (Git, Maven, jenkins and related java dependencies) in **Jenkins-server** and installed **Tomcat** in tomcat server using **script**.

 **--->** In **Jenkins-server** with server PUBLIC-IP launched Jenkins with default port number **8080** and completed all the set ups.

 **--->** In Jenkins page navigated to following to install related **Plug-Ins** required: **Mangejenkins--plug-ins--available-plun-ins---(pipeline stage view, blue ocean, deploy war to container)**

 **--->** Created a free-style job and added git repository (https://github.com/sumanthtony/one_repo), and in **build steps** selected **invote top level maven targets** and given the command **mvn clean package** : Just by giving this command it will perform **Unit Testing, Compilation, get Packages** **(WAR FILE)**

 NOTE: SINCE I HAVE ALREADY INSTALLED MAVEN PACKAGE IN THE SERVER DIRECTLY, SO I HAVE GIVEN **mvn clean package** IF WE DIDN'T WANT TO INSTALL MAVEN IN THE SERVER AND NEED TO PERFORM IN JENKINS PAGE WE CAN CONFIGURE **MANAGEJENKINS-TOOLS** SEARCH FOR MAVEN AND COMPLETE THE STEPS AND USE IN JOB BY GIVING **clean package**

 **--->** After build is success we can see the complete details in **Console Output** and in the **workspace** under **target-WAR file** will be present or we can even check the war-file by copying the build path and pasting in the server as well.

 **--->** I have deployed this **WAR-FILE** into **Tomcat server** to deploy the application for that I have installed **tomcat using script** in tomcat server and accessed with port number **8080** 

**--->** In our Demo-job I have configured in **Post-build actions** and to deploy in tomcat application.

**--->** After build is successfull in Jenkins page application is deployed in Tomcat application we are able to access the application. 

**--->** Below are the snapshots
